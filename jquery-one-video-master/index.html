    The North East Line is a high-capacity Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore. Operated by SBS Transit, the 20-kilometre (12 mi) line runs from HarbourFront station in southern Singapore to Punggol station in the northeast via Chinatown, Little India, Serangoon and Hougang. Completed at a cost of S$5 billion, the line began operating 14 of its 16 stations on 20 June 2003. Buangkok station opened on 15 January 2006, and Woodleigh station began operations on 20 June 2011. A one-station extension to Punggol Coast station is expected to be completed in 2024. Alstom rolling stock – C751A (examples pictured) and C751C – runs on the line, which is fully automated using the moving block Alstom Urbalis 300 communications-based train control signalling system. The stations are wheelchair-accessible, and most are Civil Defence shelters designed to withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks. There are 18 artworks displayed across its 16 stations as part of the MRT network's Art-in-Transit programme.
